        <p>The £20-£1000 challenge consists of placing a £20 bet during any inplay football match. Should the bet win, then the winning amount from the bet is rolled over to the next bet. This is repeated until the winning amount exceeds £1000. Sounds easy?</p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Example -</h3>
        <div class="example-block">
            <h5>Bet 1</h5>
            <p>

        <div class="example-block example-blockright">
            <h5>Bet 2</h5>
            <p>
                <strong>Liverpool vs Everton</strong><br>

        <p>This then carries on until the bet reaches £1000 or loses. Our system keeps a track on each members winnings and losses. It also ranks each player, so we can really see who is the best at inplay betting.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Using a betting company</h3>
        <p>To use our system and generate odds and winnings, you need to have a betting account with a bookmaker. We recommend using Bet365, as they have the best inplay odds and range of matches but you can also use other companies like William Hill, Paddy Power, Coral etc.</p>
        <p>You will need to use our system simultaneously with your betting account. You open your betting software and look through the matches and inplay bets. Once you find your perfect bet, you record your bet data in your challenge page and wait to see if it's wins or loses. If it wins, then you repeat this.</p>
        <p>Whether you place real money on your bets is at your discretion. Our system can be used with, or without, placing real money.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Not wanting to complete the challenge</h3>
        <p>If you don't want to play our challenge then our system can be used another way. It allows you to follow other people trying the challenge. This can give you valuable inplay tips and our latest bets page shows all the current inplay bets in order. It provides a great tipping service for your own inplay bets.</p>
        <p>Once you are following a certain member, our system will track their bets for you and then email you once they place their latest bet. This then allows you to keep up to date on their latest inplay bets.</p>

            <div class="img"><img src='@Url.Content("~/Styles/images/step2.jpg")' alt="" /></div>

            <p>
                Then you need to look through the games and pick out the inplay game you want to bet on. In this example we have chosen Astra Giurgiu vs Rapid Beucharest.<br />
                The game is currently 1-0 to Astra and it is in the 51st minute. We have chosen the inplay bet over 1.5 match goals and the odds are 4/9.

                The decision whether to stake real money on the bet is at your own discression and do not take  any responsibility for any losses.

                The box will then change to the win/loss option.<br />
                All the bet details are recorded and it now depends on the outcome of the bet.

            <p>
                You can now click on the win button and bet 1 is recorded as a win.<br />
                It then opens up bet 2 and this amount placed is set at the winning amount of bet 1. This is then repeated bet by bet, until the £1000 barrier is broken.

            <p>After submitting bet 2, it takes you back to the win/loss screen. Unfortunately, this time the bet loses and the challenge is lost.</p>

            <p>
                Once a challenge has been lost, it is recorded as a red challenge and shows the details of the bets.<br />
                Should you complete the challenge, it is shown as a winning green bar.<br />
